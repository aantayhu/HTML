This journal article analyzes the concept of Internet of Drones and its relation to improved safety
and quality of life. It helped me get a good perspective on the future of drone commercial use. It
also helped get a clear understanding of the commercial market and how drones can be effective
at providing need and commercial services. This study also gave examples of specific fields
drone delivery has benefited in and the companies concreting in those specific fields. It helped
me conclude how Amazon could better its current situation. Moreover, it helped me convey that
there are variety of paths Amazon Prime Air could take moving forward: essentially reinforcing
my argument in my future use section.

The article gave a lot of detail of the mismanagement and confusion of Amazon’s stuff on the
project as well as exclusive media coverage on the failures of Amazon. This not only helped give
context of the current use of the technology, but it also helped me understand the extent of the
development of the service. It confirmed my suspicions of commercial drone use being far ahead
than what Amazon’s promotional material would like to convey. It also gave me the specific
number of lay offs of workers under the division.

This article helped identify clear environmental issues with the concept of a commercial drone
delivery service. It also helped me compare the energy consumption between drone delivery and
on-ground delivery. It helped me conclude commercial drone deliver’s environmentally
friendliness depends on its time spent in the air and the distance it travels. It also helped me
conclude that Amazon Prime Air needs to stay within this restriction for its claim of lower
energy consumption to be true. It me further convey that the service is far away from completion.

This source gave me the framework in which Amazon Prime Air was seeking to operate on:
networks. It helped identify weaknesses in the systems and subsequent security concerns for
hacking. The helped me convey the unavoidable tradeoffs that consumers would have to face
with service. It also helped me confirm existing vagueness from the company’s executives. It
reinforced my argument that Amazon gradually compressed the project down.

The sources summarize all the patents Amazon acquired in a clear and simple way to determine
Prime Air’s design and systems moving forward. This webpage helped confirm many concepts
and facts about Amazon Prime Air. This included the networks in which the drones would be
operated under, the methods of data collection, and its safety methods relating to object collision.
It gave several examples of patents that Amazon acquired to use for context. It helped me
conclude that Amazon had many systems in place that could also lead to ethical issues relating to
the customer.

This source gives a variety of relevant information not only broad ethical concerns, such as with
the environment. It also reinforces legal information from another source. The source brings up
relevant concepts related to drone technology and its relationship to cost alongside man driven
trucks. It also brought traffic congestion and pollution with fuel usage. This source also gave me
a new perspective on what kind of communities the service will mostly benefit - those with large
land areas, a low population density, and high labor costs. It helps me conclude that Amazon
needs to stay within set restrictions for it to claim environmental friendliness.

This video gives me a clear example of not only a successfully implemented drone delivery
service but also a profitable framework that Amazon Prime Air could and probably should adopt
moving forward. Zipline’s service filled a role in Rwanda that only it alone could fill: the
delivery of essential medical products in a place in which extremely poor infrastructure impedes
any kind of on-the-ground delivery. Although Zipline’s fleet of autonomous drones are designed
a little bit differently, the video proved that Zipline’s innovative methods were crucial to
service’s success and in part is the reason for the company’s expansion. The source also
reinforces the notion that Amazon Prime Air could be focused on other sectors of the market,
besides e-commerce, and still maintain future profits. The video also helps me conclude that
Amazon’s drone delivery service can still possibly be innovative, successfully implemented, and
be commercially used in the future.

This image helped me convey the abstractness yet tenableness of my research topic in my introduction section in my website. It gets to the point of how easily drone technology could be implemented in the e-commerce world. And it also speaks to how a service, owned by a significant company, has utilized this technology to try to revolutionize the e-commerce market and successfully pushed the implementation of drones into the mainstream consciousness.

		The artwork is original and created by me. The Artwork is a photograph that I have personally taken; a town within the mountains that is difficult to access by ground transportation. I further edited and added to the photograph with drone graphic I created in Microsoft Paint and added text in Paint 3D, with Paint 3D being the tool I mostly used to edit the photograph. The artwork helped me show how a possible future with Amazon Prime Air could look like. However, it also helped me establish my central point my future use section: the future of Amazon Prime Air is uncertain, and that service should look for new perspectives to increase its likelihood of success.

		This image helped me convey the privacy concerns that come with Amazon Prime Air in the ethical and social concerns section in my website. Done technology although innovative still has built-in GPS tracking and camera detection systems. This concern is inherent to the service and this image properly conveys just how thorough these drones would surveil customers. Moreover, the technology’s popularity among the public would only make this concern more common to the point people would feel strongly about whether even using the service or not.

		This video helped showcase how Amazon Prime Air would handle many physical concerns the public might have in my security concerns section of my website. More specifically, the video displays an obstacle avoidance system imbedded in a drone’s software that is like that of Amazon Prime Air’s series of imbedded directives and collision detection. The movement and detection on display by the video is essential in understanding how vital collision avoidance is to the long-term success of the service.

		This image helped me convey how secretive the drone project by Amazon has gotten, and to what lengths the company has gone to for the project to fall below the public eye. The image successfully visualizes the idea that the current use of the service is not open the public just yet. It implies that people should come to terms with that fact and recognize the reasons for why that came to be.
