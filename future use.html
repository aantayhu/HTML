		The future of Amazon’s Drone delivery service is uncertain. Once the trails are
completed, the service will have to meet new regulatory standards and restrictions set by the
FAA as well as by local and state governments (Amazon, 2020). With gigantic inherent concerns
still present and its parent company moving discreetly to compress the project, Amazon Prime
Air will likely take more than just a few years to finish developing. Moreover, in its current
design, the service will likely only be used in certain circumstances and for certain types of
customers. However, due to Amazon’s history of expansion into new markets and applications,
the service could, and probably should, also change its approach. Amazon Prime Air could
follow the lead of other drone delivery services and concentrate on a more specific market
instead of the broader e-commerce world. For example, the service could concentrate on food
delivery, or it could even be applied to more lifesaving sectors such as with medical care
delivery and search and rescue (Abdelmaboud, 2021).

		This evolution into a concentration may ultimately yield better results for Prime Air as
one company has proven. In a YouTube video titled “How Rwanda Built A Drone Delivery
Service”, the company Zipline is shown to have not only successfully engineered a fleet of
plane-like drones that can travel great distances with payloads of over one and a half kilograms
but also found new simple methods to vastly decrease loading time, take-off time, and landing
time; all of this to instantly deliver vital medical supplies to rural health centers in Rwanda,
which currently cannot be viably reached out to by any on-the-ground delivery method (Real
Engineering, 2019). Essentially, the service managed to fill a role desperately needed by a
certain group of people that only it alone could fill. Although Zipline’s fleet of autonomous
drones are designed a little bit differently, service’s innovative methods and market focus were
crucial to its success and in part are responsible for the company’s expansion. It is an excellent
example of what Amazon Prime Air could turn into and has the best perspective that the service
could take for the future. Although the service is far from finished, Amazon Prime Air has
changed the discourse of commercial drone delivery technology and has the potential to continue
to change it in this decade.
