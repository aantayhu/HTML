		From the beginning, the goal for Amazon Prime Air was simple yet intriguing: “deliver…
packages [via drones] to the customers’ doorstep in 30 minutes or less… [with the weight of the
package per drone being] 5 pounds or less” (Amazon, 2020). In fact, the idea was so simple and
intriguing, that the media along with the drone market went into a frenzy, which finally brought
the concept of a commercial drone delivery service into the mainstream consciousness. However,
it was not until 2020 that Amazon gained governmental approval to conduct trial operations. In
an article titled “Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery wins FAA approval!” Apparel Resources
reports that, “under Part 135 of FAA regulations,” the air carrier certificate given to Amazon 
Prime Air allows their drones to, “carry payloads ‘beyond the visual line of sight’ of the
operator” (2020). As this news circulated, the media again began speculating about the drones’
hexagonal next gen hybrid model (Fisher, 2020). They even began predicting likely drone testing
sights, specifically the Vancouver and UK area, due to Amazon’s history of limited testing on
those regions (Fisher, 2020). If one believes the framing of the media, apart from a few legal
setbacks, everything was going according to plan.

		However, as the media frenzy died down again, the few who were paying attention
noticed that Amazon not only began to slow the project down but also drastically began to scale
it down.</p>
		<ul>
		
		<li>The company gradually stopped giving tours of its “secretive” drone lab in the UK</li>
		
		<li>stopped creating promotional videos for Prime Air</li>
		
		<li>omitted any specifics about the confirmed stuff changes as well as any raw numbers on the progression of the drone trails (Kersley, 2021).</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="title">
In 2021, Amazon even laid off one hundred of its Prime Air employees in the
U.K. after prior reports of mismanagement and staff confusion (Isobel, 2021). All of this would
prompt anyone to not only doubt Amazon’s reaffirmations of its investment in commercial drone
delivery but also Prime Air’s feasibility in its current design. Thus, in 2022, many in the media
increasingly agree with this doubt. Amazon Prime Air has fallen from the public eye and is still
yet to see any kind of tangible commercial use, and experts in the drone technology field have
begun to propose new designs and perspectives for the commercial use of drone technology.
