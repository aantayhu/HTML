		However, if the service does finish developing the next few years and is ready for
commercial use, what is the most vital concern the public should comprehend before using the
service? Amazon Prime Air, like any other digital service, must deal with security concerns,
specifically relating to information security and physical safety. Amazon’s approach and designs
for the service would not only determine how well these concerns are addressed but also whether
customers even consider using the service or not. Since the service is planned to be connected to
networks for flight control management and drone-to-drone communication, Amazon Prime Air
would be an obvious target for network hackers and drone hijackers (Mac, 2015). Thus, Amazon
for the last decade has poured vast amounts of resources into acquiring several network and
information security patents to counteract any possible attacks (Michel, 2017). However, this
does not guarantee the service’s full security and the company would have to constantly update
and develop new defenses against these attacks.

		Furthermore, a similar thing can be said for Prime Air’s address of physical security.
Patents awarded to Amazon in 2015 explain that the drones would also be imbedded with a
series of prime directives and detection devices to avoid colliding with objects, even if the drone
loses control or power (Michel, 2017). These patents also present communication systems and
distance determining software dedicated to finding alternative paths and landing areas after
avoiding those collisions (Michel, 2017). However, just like with information security, Amazon
Prime Air cannot fully guarantee zero collisions from occurring. Coding errors along with unique
unaccounted circumstances inevitably will emerge. Users of the service would need understand
that these problems can only be remedied and never fully solved, that this tradeoff is the price for
supposedly more convenience.
