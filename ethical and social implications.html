		More importantly, however, Amazon’s countermeasures ignore the inherent privacy
concerns of any commercial drone delivery service: GPS tracking and camera detection systems.
In fact, Amazon is betting that the delivery service will open a new door for data collection and
subsequent profit. In 2017, Amazon was awarded a patent for a proposed system that analyzes
drone video data and identifies key features of each delivery destination all to produce future
product recommendations (Michel, 2017). These concerns are not just about the common
algorithmic surveillance issues that come with any digital service; it is about the cheer extent of
what kind of data collected. With this, Amazon would be able to generate recommendations
based on footage of the user’s yard, car, house, and even their appearance. Customers essentially
would have to decide whether the price of convenient delivery is also worth surrendering even
more of their privacy.

		Moreover, due to it being tied to Amazon’s well-known brand, if Prime Air ever finishes
developing with its current design, the company will have to deal with an unavoidable high
usage rate. And the public would subsequently have to deal with its unavoidable environmental
effects. Experts say that using drones instead of traditional ground vehicles to deliver packages
would save energy consumption, only if the drones travel at high speeds for a certain short
distance and time (Lucas, 2021). Thus, Amazon Prime Air would have to be implemented
accordingly to have any claim of being energy cost friendly. However, that means that Amazon
must also account for that short time and distance from where the drones are sent, which may be
a harder than most would think. Studies show only communities with large land areas, a low
population density, and high labor costs would stand to benefit from drone delivery in relation to
traffic congestion and fuel pollution, only if these certain measures are taken (Park, 2018). After
years of Amazon claiming that Amazon Prime Air would be environmentally friendly, the truth
is that the claim is only true if they stay within a publicly unrecognized set of restrictions.
