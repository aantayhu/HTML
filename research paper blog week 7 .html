<p class="title"> <b> Introduction </b></p>
<p class="title2"> Amazon Prime. It needs no introduction. Over a decade ago, the American multinational conglomerate, Amazon, revolutionized e-commerce through its now well-known, reliable, and unlimited next-day delivery service. As millions of people have come to realize when using the service, Prime’s success is mainly due to its exceptional customer experience. However, many fail to realize that this is not only a goal for the delivery service, but it is the company’s main business technology model. This has prompted Amazon to further invest in various projects over the years to increase Prime’s quality of its users, which led to another possible revolution in the e-commerce world. In 2013, Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos officially announced plans for a new commercial drone delivery service: Amazon Prime Air. The goal was for the service to be ready for commercial use in some cities beginning in late 2019, but the service has yet to complete even that goal as of 2022. As Prime Air continues to be developed, the public should understand the service’s current use, its differing security aspects, its ethical and social implications, as well as its future use in the coming years, because the service may not develop like most may believe.

<p class="title"> <b> Summary </b></p>
<p class="title2"> In 2022, despite its progress in obtaining certification from the FAA to conduct trials, many not only doubt Amazon’s reaffirmations of its investment in commercial drone delivery but also Prime Air’s feasibility in its current design. Amazon Prime Air has fallen from the public eye and is still yet to see any kind of tangible commercial use, and experts in the drone technology field have begun to propose new designs and perspectives for the commercial use of drone technology. Amazon Prime Air, like any other digital service, must deal with security concerns, specifically relating to information security and physical safety. Coding errors along with unique unaccounted circumstances inevitably will emerge. Users of the service would need to understand that network security and collision countermeasures will never fully be solved, and that this is a tradeoff, the price for supposedly more convenience in delivery. More importantly, however, Amazon’s security defenses ignore the inherent privacy concerns of any commercial drone delivery service such as with GPS tracking and camera detection systems. Furthermore, the public would subsequently have to deal with its unavoidable environmental effects that depend on time and distance the individual drones have to travel for. The future of Amazon’s Drone delivery service is uncertain and should probably consider a different approach to find more success in commercial delivery.
